TODO LIST:

1. set up event listener on ImageTableEntryView that listens for click event and invokes this.model.changeImage()

2. set up listener in AppModel that will set
currentImage to the new image

3. set up listener in AppView that listens for change to currentImage. When a change is detected it we need to call ImagePanelView.setImage()  (once we make Image Panel View)

4.
